# Fokus - A Pomodoro Timer

Fokus is a productivity application that implements the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. The technique uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "pomodoros". The Fokus application helps users manage their work sessions and breaks, aiming to improve focus and productivity.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Focus**: By working in short, timed intervals, users can maintain high levels of concentration.
- **Reduced Burnout**: Regular breaks help prevent mental fatigue.
- **Improved Productivity**: Structured work sessions can lead to more efficient task completion.

Fokus is designed to help users manage their time effectively and achieve their goals with greater efficiency.
